# mediaplayergui
MediaPlayer GUI created in Java

This Java Application created with FXML file can play a video, a song, or a whole playlist.
If we click a "plus button" we can choose a video file to play.
If we click a "note button" we can choose a music file to play.
If we click a "note list button" we can import a playlist into our mediaplayer. When we do every song will be listed on the right side and you can double click to switch between them, or you can simply click left or right button to switch songs.
The "hidden eye" button will remove the side bar off screen.

Our mediaplayer has features of every media player, we can slide to fastforward or rewind the song and we can adjust volume on volume bar slider. Also there are a shuffle and repeat buttons.
